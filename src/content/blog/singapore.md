I found myself in Singapore.

Admittedly this is not entirely unexpected, as I did book the flights a few months ago, and was fully conscious for all but a couple of hours of the 12 hour flight in from London.

Initial observations:

- ATMs like to give you $50 notes. This sounds sensible if you think that this is about Â£18, but becomes less so when you have to pay a taxi $15 to get you from the airport to your hotel.
- Air Conditioning is fantastic. Until you walk outside and you melt before you even walk as far as a taxi.
- Food can be very cheap. A rather tasty lunch cost about $2.
- Hotel food is not. This surprises, I suspect, no one.
- The internet is about 100ms further away than it was in London or Vancouver.
- Taxis are cheap. People are currently moaning that prices are increasing, but they're still remarkably cheaper than the UK, Canada, and even New Zealand. Not all people are complaining however. At any rate, the subway is also cheap.
