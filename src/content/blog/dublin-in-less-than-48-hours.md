In which I visit another country.

Aer Lingus managed to, over the course of a weekend, both frustrate and redeem itself. Most airlines take at least twice the time. This story is not, however, about Aer Lingus. (The cheque from the marketing department bounced.)

The hotel, named The Parliament Hotel until the day before we arrived and then renamed The Arlington Hotel Temple Bar. Staff were friendly, breakfast was acceptable (the hot stuffs could have done with being just a little hotter), and location was great. A bit of a stretch to call it Temple Bar, but then we didn't book there with that enticement, so not really a con for us.

Only managed 4 things:

- Dublinia, where upon I learned interesting things about the history of Dublin, including how to write my own name in some long-unused script of some sort.
- Christ Church Cathedral, where I saw a fantastic pipe organ (I love the things), a crypt that is far too lit but contains rather pretty treasures
- Hop-on Hop-off Bus tour, without the whole "hopping" part (we stayed on for a complete circuit). Entertaining tour guide, as promised in the brochure.
- Book of Kells, fantastically old. Pleasingly dark. Great intro display. Annoyingly â‚¬8. Worth a visit none the less.

Will have to visit again soon.
