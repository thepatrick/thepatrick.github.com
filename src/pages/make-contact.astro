      <h2>Make contact</h2>

      <p>
        Normally here would appear a contact form, but I don't have one ready
        yet (this yet has been here for 10 years, d'oh). Instead please reach
        out using the social networks/sites on the <a href="/#about">about</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might also be able to guess an email address. I suggest trying
        hello@ the domain you are currently viewing this on.

      <h3>Note to recruiters</h3>

      <p>ðŸ‘‹</p>

      <p>
        It's nice to meet you, but you are not an emergency. I'm happy in my
        current role, and an unexpected phone call is very likely to make a very
        negative impression of both you and your clients. Stick to email!
